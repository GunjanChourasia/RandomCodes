1. Videstream.py 

	Libraries Used : pygame, pyQt4

	Description : On running this program through the terminal, the program opens a live streaming camera which can capture an image named 'capture.jpg'. this image can be modified using the below mentioned scripts.

2. gsconvert.py

	Libraries used : cv2

	Description : converts the 'capture.jpg' into greyscale named 'grey.jpg'

3. slice.py

	Libraries used : cv2 and PIL

	Description : slices the 'grey.jpg' into equal sized 'n' numbered images.

PIL is used in the 3rd script for getting the width and height. If not possible you can manually enter the width and height and comment the PIL lines.

I have used 3 different scripts so that i can easily embedd them into an GUI.
